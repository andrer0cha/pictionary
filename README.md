- Install by following the instructions for your platform.
- After installation, check with:
  ```sh
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

### How to Install Python and pip

- Install by following the instructions for your platform.
- Make sure to check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.
- After installation, check with:
  ```sh
  python --version
  pip --version
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd pictionary/
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

## Running the Game

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   # Activate the virtual environment if not already active
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
   The backend will start on http://localhost:8000

2. **Start the frontend app:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

3. **Open your browser and go to:**
   [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Troubleshooting

- If you get `Failed to scan for dependencies from entries: ...` or `Cannot find module` errors when running `npm run dev`, make sure you:
  - Are in the `frontend` directory when running `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
  - Have a valid `package.json` in the `frontend` folder.
  - If problems persist, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again:
    ```sh
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```
- If you get Python errors, make sure your virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed.
